Hi, I am a graduate student in Physics at NC State University. I am enthusiastic to learn different things in life. I try to read various books and play soccer with my friends in my free time.

<!-- ## Current Interests and Projects:

* Molecular Simulation of Polymers
* High-order harmonic generation from confined Rydberg atoms -->
